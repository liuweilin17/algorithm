To READERS:
    Actually, there are many versions of classic algorithms when we search on the Internet.
    Inevitably, some of them are incomplete, mistaken or obscure to read.
    When taking the course 'Algorithms and Data Structures' in UofT, we are required to read the textbook, 
    which is 'Introduction to Algorithms(3rd Edition)'.
    I found the book is really comprehensive, well-organized and gives detailed explanation of
    algorithms and structures.
    Therefore, I found it really meaningful to implement the pseudocode in the book.
    And the codes in this diretory are in Python2.7 versions.
    P.S, some pseudocode are optimized. And I will try to maintain the original version
    in the same time.
